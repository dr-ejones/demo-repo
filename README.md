# Introduction

This readme is an attempt at learning how to navigate Git and Github without embarassing myself. 
It was generated with a command from Git Bash, and will be used to practice commits and such.

## First Log

The order of operations that lead to this repository being shared between my local machine and GitHub
took some finagling because I initialized the repository locally first and then separately on GitHub. 

I was able to merge everything with the following commands:

    $ git fetch
    $ git rebase origin/main
    $ git push origin main
